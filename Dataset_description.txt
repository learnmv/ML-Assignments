In dataset, Each record represents follow-up data for one breast cancer case. 

Feature Information:
1) ID number
2) Outcome (R = recur, N = nonrecur)
3) Time (recurrence time if field 2 = R, disease-free time if 
	field 2	= N)
4-33) Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
it describe characteristics of the cell nuclei

	a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
	b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
	c) perimeter
	d) area
	e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
	f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
	g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
	h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
	i) symmetry 
	j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each cell nuclei 

34) Tumor size - diameter of the excised tumor in centimeters
35) Lymph node status - number of positive axillary lymph nodes
observed at time of surgery
